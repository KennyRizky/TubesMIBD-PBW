        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p class="visimisitext">
        Learning is the source of human progress.

        It has the power to transform our world
        from illness to health,
        from poverty to prosperity,
        from conflict to peace.

        It has the power to transform our lives
        for ourselves,
        for our families,
        for our communities.
        </p>

        <p class="visimisitext">
        No matter who we are or where we are,
        learning empowers us to change and grow
        and redefine what’s possible.
        That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
